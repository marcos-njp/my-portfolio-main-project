# Where is Prisma Data Stored?

## 🎯 Your Database Location

Your chat data is stored in **Neon Postgres** (cloud database), NOT on your local computer.

### Database URL
```
postgresql://neondb_owner:...@ep-falling-bar-a1h7pgv1-pooler.ap-southeast-1.aws.neon.tech/neondb
```

## ✅ How It Works

### When Deployed on Vercel:
1. User asks a question → Chat API processes it
2. After AI responds → Analytics API logs to Neon database
3. Data is **automatically saved** to cloud database
4. **NO need for `pnpm db:studio` to be running on Vercel**

### The database is:
- ✅ **Always accessible** (24/7 cloud storage)
- ✅ **Persists data** even when local server is off
- ✅ **Shared across deployments** (same database for all environments)

## 📊 How to View Your Data

### Option 1: Prisma Studio (Local Tool)
```bash
pnpm db:studio
```
- Opens at `http://localhost:5557`
- **Just a viewer** - connects to the cloud database
- Can run anywhere (local computer, different machine)
- Shows live data from Neon

### Option 2: Neon Console (Web Interface)
1. Go to https://console.neon.tech
2. Login to your account
3. Select your project
4. Click "Tables" or "SQL Editor"
5. View all ChatLog and FrequentQuestion data

### Option 3: Direct SQL Query
```sql
-- See all chat logs
SELECT * FROM "ChatLog" ORDER BY timestamp DESC LIMIT 100;

-- See most asked questions
SELECT * FROM "FrequentQuestion" ORDER BY count DESC LIMIT 20;
```

## 🚀 Production Workflow

```
User on Vercel site
    ↓
Asks question to AI
    ↓
AI responds (streamed)
    ↓
Analytics API called (background)
    ↓
Data saved to Neon Postgres ✅
    ↓
You can view it anytime via:
  - Prisma Studio (local tool)
  - Neon Console (web)
  - SQL queries
```

## 💡 Key Points

1. **Database runs 24/7** - Not dependent on your local server
2. **Prisma Studio is just a viewer** - Like opening Excel to view a file
3. **Data persists forever** (until you delete it)
4. **Multiple ways to access** - Choose what's convenient
5. **Works on Vercel** - No local services needed

## 🔍 Check if It's Working

After deployment, check Vercel logs:
```
[Analytics] 📤 Sending to: https://your-site.vercel.app/api/analytics/log
[Analytics API] 📝 Received request: ...
[Analytics API] ✅ Successfully logged to database
[Analytics] ✅ Logged successfully to database
```

Then view data:
```bash
pnpm db:studio
# or visit https://console.neon.tech
```

**Your data is safe in the cloud!** 🎉
